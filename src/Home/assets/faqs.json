  {
    "q": "How do referrals work?",
    "a": "Once your BSC wallet is connected to the BUSD Miner website, you will notice your referral address appear at the bottom of the page. When a new user hires miners after clicking your personal referral link, the contract will send a BUSD value equal to 12% instantly to your Lucky Cats. Be smart, use it to buy cats and build yourself a stream of income."
